# Description
A simple vertical-scrolling rhythm game made with Electron, a Python server, and JS/HTML/CSS.
Played casually; 100% skill-based with no levels, upgrades, in-game currency or progression. This game might not be suited for beginners- it's intended more as a hardcore challenge, reminiscent of Dark Souls... so don't be surprised if the 'relaxed' difficulty feels about right and 'normal' is difficult; I based it mostly on my personal experience and skill level.
